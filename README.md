automarkdown
============

Convert a file into HTML with whatever `markdown` points to in your `$PATH`.
This is dumb, but I don't wanna mess around with stupid extensions manually.
All this does is automate creating an output file.

All documentation is in the script and can be viewed with the `-h` option.

`install` merely makes a 2 symbolic links in your `~/bin/`: one to
`~/bin/automarkdown`, and another `~/bin/md` pointing to the first link.
